# Intro to collaborative coding

#### Tip: this is a markdown file. It uses a set of [symbols](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to allow rapid formatting of the document. You can use a text editor or a specialised markdown editor (such as [Remarkable](https://remarkableapp.github.io/)).

## About

This is not meant to be a guide to programming. It's also not meant to be a definitive guide to *Python*, *testing*, *version control* or any other topic mentioned here.

This is meant to be a collection of *examples* and *links* to hopefully spark off some discussion of important aspects of **collaborative scientific coding** for new students in the [Orengo lab](www.orengogroup.info).

The intention is for students to document their answers in [their own fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of this project.

Notes on the questions below:

 * These questions do not have a single correct answer
 * Hopefully your answers will improve as you get more experience
 * Try and answer in your own words

Feel free to copy and paste quotes from elsewhere (with links to the original source). By the end of your project you will hopefully be able to answer the questions in your own words from a position of experience (which is far more valuable).

 	* 
 1. when should it be used?
 	* 
 1. what does a [basic git flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows) look like? (and [more complex flows](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/))

### 3. Testing 

 1. why is testing important?

 1. what is CI? (key aspects? why is it useful?)
 	* 
 1. what is benchmarking? how is it different to testing?
 	* Benchmark is concerned with performance.

### 4. DRY

 1. what does it mean?
 	* "[Don't repeat yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)"
 1. why is it important?
 	* Code/Data integrity (Refer to data integrity.) That means less reduandency and less prone to random mutations.
 1. how does this idea translate into code?
 	* 
 1. are there any exceptions where you might want to ignore this? (hint: *dependencies*)
	* Overhead of dependency and copyright problem.

### 5. Organisation

 1. where's your data? tests? libraries? scripts?
 	* 
 1. documentation
	 * Document at different levels. 
 1. why? where? who is it for? (hint: *you in X months time*)
 	*
 1. different types of documentation
	* 
 1. considering maintenance
	* 
 1. how to encourage good documentation?
	*
